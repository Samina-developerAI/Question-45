// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


// showMagicians function
function showMagicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    magicians.forEach((magician) => {
      console.log(magician);
    });
  }
  
 
  function makeGreat(magicians: string[]): string[] {
    return magicians.map((magician) => `the Great ${magician}`);
  }
  
  // magician names
  const magicianNames: string[] = ["Harry potter", "Albus Dumbledore", "Hermione", "Ron ", "Luna"];
  

  const greatMagicians = makeGreat(magicianNames);
  
  
  showMagicians(greatMagicians);
